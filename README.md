Todo-list---FCC
Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this TODO application, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements.

Step 1: Accessing Elements
In this project, you will learn how localStorage works in JavaScript by building a Todo app. localStorage is a web storage feature of JavaScript that lets you persist data by storing the data as a key:value pair.

The HTML and CSS for this project have been provided for you. Take a look at the files to get yourself familiarized with them.

Begin by accessing the task-form, confirm-close-dialog, and open-task-form-btn elements with the getElementById() method. Save them in the variables taskForm, confirmCloseDialog, and openTaskFormBtn.

javascript
Copy code
const taskForm = document.getElementById("task-form");
const confirmCloseDialog = document.getElementById("confirm-close-dialog");
const openTaskFormBtn = document.getElementById("open-task-form-btn");
These elements are crucial for interacting with the user interface and managing tasks in your Todo application. Once you have these elements accessed, you can proceed to handle form inputs, manage local storage, and implement CRUD operations.
